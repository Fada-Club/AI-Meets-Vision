"Maria Assumpta Convent Sr. Sec. School was founded in the year 1988. It is situated in the Kashipur, Uttrakhand and is therefore an ideal institution for children whose health and well being is a matter of great importance for their parents/guardians. Maria Assumpta Convent Sr. Sec. School, Kashipur is a Co-Educational English medium Institution run by the Catholic Minority. It is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. Maria Assumpta Sr. Sec. School is managed by the Catholic Diocese of Bareilly through a Registered Body Called The Alphonsus Catholic Education Society. The Medium of instruction from LKG to Class Twelve is English. Today, the role of a school is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of an ever changing global society.
Our aim is to help students to realize their potential. Instead of wasting time worrying about what they don't have or what they can't do, spend time in working at things they can do.
Our educational philosophy is centered on praise, encouragement, enthusiasm, and affection, rather than criticism, fear, and punishment. We constantly work to develop a sense of discipline and good moral character, where all students are expected to confirm to high disciplinary standards and to develop values of tolerance, fair play, compassion, integrity and fortitude.
We are trying to provide our students with an atmosphere of multifaceted development, where children are encouraged to channelize their potential in the pursuit of excellence. This can only be possible in a holistic and student-centric environment. The talents, skills, and abilities of each student need to be identified, nurtured, and encouraged so that he/she is able to reach greater heights. We are providing our Students a platform to think, express, and exhibit their skills. It is necessary to empower them to negotiate several issues that confront them, with the teacher being a facilitator."
